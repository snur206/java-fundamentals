Lab 1:

Reference help from akkaben

## Lab 2:

Added a test and method for roll dice and for the contains duplicates

## Lab 3:

Worked the first two feature tasks using HashSet to collect the unique temp items, iterate from min to max temp, and create string that has any temp not seen during the month. Created a tally function for list of strings for votes and returns one string of the most votes.

## Lab 6:

Creating constructors for restaurants that take a name, number of stars between 0 and 5, and a price. Also, creating constructors for reviews that take a body(text), an author, and a number of stars. Test restaurant code to see if the name of the restaurant, stars, and price by seeing if the assertSame, and using the same for Review but for body(text), an author, and a number of stars.

## Lab 7:

Creating classes for Shops and theaters, adding reviews for them and for theaters, similar to lab 6. Also, adding and removing a movie. Using tests to see if the reviews are working properly by using assert true and false for both the shop and theater.
