## Lab 3:

Worked the first two feature tasks using HashSet to collect the unique temp items, iterate from min to max temp, and create string that has any temp not seen during the month. Created a tally function for list of strings for votes and returns one string of the most votes. Also, created a linter directory, that reads a JS file with a given Path, generates an error message  whenever it finds a line that doesnâ€™t end in a semi-colon.
